# Rock, Paper, Scissors
Rock, Paper, Scissors is a project I created while following The Odin Project's curriculum. This project is intended as a learning exercise, specifically using JavaScript.

## Learning Focus
- JavaScript - use of variables, functions, methods.
- Git - consistent commits with well written messages.

## Areas for Improvement
 - Better, more consistent use of comments.
 - Error handling:
	 - If playRound is passed a playerSelection that doesn't meet expectations.
